## Slot-Machine-Project

This is my first attempt at programming using R. I used the textbook "Hands-on Programming with R" by Garrett Grolemund to guide me through the process of getting started with R, learning how to utilize it's basic functions, and wrap the functions learned into an example project of a slot machine. 

This slot machine is modeled after a real life machine from Manitoba, Canada that were a source of scandal in the 90s for their pay back claims. 

Along with learning how to write programs and run simulations in R, working through this textbook also taught me how to:
- Chapters 1-2: use the RStudio interface, run commands, create objects, write my own functions and scripts, use R packages, generate random samples, and create quick plots.
- Chapters 3-6: save character strings and logical values; save data sets as vectors, matrices, data frames, and arrays; extract individual values from a data set; change individual values in a data set, write logical tests, and use NA.
- Chapters 7-10: use practical strategies to design programs,utilize if and else statements, create lookup tables for finding values, use for and repeat loops to automate repetitive operations, use S3 methods (object-oriented programming), measure code speed, and write faster code using vectorization.
